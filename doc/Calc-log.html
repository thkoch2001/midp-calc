<h1><a href="Calc.html">Calc</a> - Java Calculator for cell-phones and
MIDP devices</h1>

<h2>Changelog:</h2>

<h3><a href="Calc450.jar">Version 4.50</a>,
<a href="CalcMIDP2450.jar">2</a>,
<a href="CalcNokia450.jar">N</a>,
2008-XX-XX, (119kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added the matrix operations "row<sub>x</sub>", "col<sub>x</sub>",
     "a<sub>max</sub>" and "a<sub>min</sub>"
  <li>Number, menu and monitor fonts can be chosen independently from both
    built-in and system fonts.
  <li>Added unit arithmetic
  <li>Programs written for a previous version of Calc that directly
     STO/RCL matrix rows above 64 will not work.
     (They will appear to contain unit statements instead)
  <li>Updated scientific constants to the CODATA internationally recommended
    values of 2006
  <li>Fixed bug displaying numbers smaller than 1 in HEX mode with
     thousands-separator enabled
  <li>Fixed bug where a matrix in y became nan after "clear"
  <li>Fixed crash when appending number (non-integer) to a short program
</ul>

<h3><a href="Calc400.jar">Version 4.00</a>,
<a href="CalcMIDP2400.jar">2</a>,
<a href="CalcNokia400.jar">N</a>,
2007-02-24, (93kB)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added grads as measure of angles, in addition to radians and degrees
  <li>Added program flow operations LBL, GTO, GSB, RTN, STOP, ISG and DSE
  <li>Long-running programs get a "screen saver" view with an option to
    halt execution
  <li>The old comparison operations x&lt;y?, x&lt;0?, etc. have been
    reimplemented for more traditional usage. Instead of pushing 0 or 1 on the
    stack, these operations now skip the next line if the result of the
    comparison is false. Programs written for a previous verision of Calc that
    use these operations <i><b>will not work as intended</b></i> in this
    version.
  <li>The source code has been reorganized into a directory structure more
    suitable for a Java IDE. Project files for the Eclipse Java IDE have been
    added, enabling development in Windows.
</ul>
